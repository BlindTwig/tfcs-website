				<h2>Who are we?</h2>
				<p>We are Concussion Studios, a team of Source Engine modders that are working together to bring Team Fortress Classic to the Source Engine.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Is there a release date?</h2>
				<p>As of now, we don't have a current release date. Our hope is to finish in the next two years or so, but we have no promises on that.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>Where will this be released?</h2>
				<p>We plan on being released on Steam, but until we can confirm that with Valve, we're simply staying on GitHub and will act as a sourcemod added to your sourcemods folder, like many others.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>How can I help?</h2>
				<p>Critisism, bug reports, encouragement, playtesting, anything along those lines can help tremendously! If you want to become part of the team, talk with our lead, Sandvich Thief#0179 on Discord.</p>

			<h2>Quick Facts:</h2>
			<article>
			</article>
			<article>
			<div>We are entirely non-profit. This is all being done on our developers's spare time, so don't expect a lot of frequent updates. We have lives outside of modding!</div>
			</article>
			<article>
			<div>Almost everything is being made from scratch, only using the original material as placeholders or references. We might end up using upscaling on certain textures to save time, but this will only be on smaller textures that won't be as easily noticed.</div>
			</article>
			<article>
			<div>Got notified that our site updated but see no changes? Reload the page! GitHub for some reason doesn't automatically update an HTML file in our website's repo when a user loads it, so you have to do it manually.</div>
