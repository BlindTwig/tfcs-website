# tfcs-website (archived)
THIS FORK IS OLD AND OUTDATED. I AM NO LONGER A PART OF CONCUSSION STUDIOS.

This fork is for me to test changes without comitting directly to the [live site](https://concussion-studios.github.io/tfcs-website).

My version of the site using this fork can be found [here](https://blindtwig.github.io/tfcs-website/) for easy access.

There are no longer any plans on using pull requests, as with how I work it's incredibly messy. If, however, it's something major like a website rework, I will be doing a pull request. Ignore any messages of this being ahead or behind [Concussion-Studios/tfcs-website](https://github.com/Concussion-Studios/tfcs-website). Instead of pull requests I'm simply going to be taking the files I know work and comitting them directly to the [repo](https://github.com/Concussion-Studios/tfcs-website) myself.
