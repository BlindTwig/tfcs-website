<title>Team Fortress Classic: Source</title>
<h3>What is TFC:Source?</h3>
<p>This is an attempt to remake and port Team Fortress Classic over to Source without the use of leaked code. The hope is for it to resemble what could have been if Valve had made it along side CS:Source and Half-Life 2. Although it will probably resemble something akin to a direct TFC SourcePort while we make newer versions of everything.</p>
<h3>Can I play it?</h3>
<p>Fortunately you can! We just released a open alpha of some sort to the public! Click our discord link below to find out more on how to play.</p>
<h3>So what can you do?</h3>
<p>Well we hope you enjoy playing our early builds and provide bug reports and feedback!</p>
